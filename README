rtspeccy is a real time spectrum analyzer. Plug in your microphone and
speak, rtspeccy shall visualize your words. rtspeccy is intended to
visualize what's being recorded, not what's being played.

Main features:

    - Keep it simple. "It" refers to the code. No complex configuration
      file, simply a config.h.
    - Displays the spectrogram using OpenGL.
    - Split screen: Show history as well as current spectrum.
    - Freeze, zooming and panning.
    - Overtone guidelines: Click and hold the left mouse button to show
      guidelines which indicate where over- and undertones of the
      current frequency are located.
    - History is colored via a color ramp.
    - Free software (GPL3+).


Installation
------------

The following libraries are required:

    - ALSA userland libraries for recording audio
    - FFTW3 for calculating the spectrum
    - A GLUT implementation, for example FreeGLUT
    - OpenGL libraries, probably Mesa on Linux

rtspeccy expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

Most of the program's options can only be set at compile time. Have a
look at the shipped config.h.example to see what's possible. It's well
documented and pretty self explanatory, but you are expected to know a
little bit of C.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install

If you're on Arch Linux, you can also use the following AUR package:

    - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rtspeccy-git/


Running
-------

As there are virtually no options, just run rtspeccy using your favorite
way of launching programs:

    $ rtspeccy

Refer to the manpage for all options and keyboard/mouse controls.
